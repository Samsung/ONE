# Heuristic Graph Partitioning

This folder contains the necessary scripts to perform a a heuristic-based graph partitioning for machine learning models.

The main contents of this folder are as follows:

- [Python Files](#python-scripts)
- [How to Run Partitioning Algorithm?](#how-to-partition-tflite-model)
- [Example Script](#example-script-to-generate-partition-map)


## Python Scripts
The python scripts (**python3**) require an installation of Tensorflow 2.x package to retrieve TFLite model operations. Additionally, please ensure that the python `numpy` package has been installed beforehand. The scripts also import the following modules: `queue`, `json` and `argparse`, all of which should be available by default. If not, please install them either by `pip install <package>` or `sudo apt install python-<package>`.

`Graph.py` is the main script that processes the model graph topology and implements the partitioning algorithm. Correspondingly, there are two classes within, namely `GraphTopology` and `GraphPartition`. `GraphTopology` has a container `GraphPartition` object within.

`graph_analysis.py` is a helper module for translating TFLite models to graph data structures. `graph_analysis.py` is imported inside
`Graph.py`.


## How To Partition TFLite Model?
To partition a TFLite model, simply `import Graph` at the outset. There are two ways to run the partitioning algorithm. If you prefer quick results without having to inspect the intermediate results, follow the steps below:

### Quick Run For Final Result
To get the partitioning result quickly, follow the steps below:

1. Create a `GraphTopology` object as shown below:
```
In [70]: g = Graph.GraphTopology('inceptionV3.tflite', 'inceptionV3.chrome.json')
```
**Note**: Here, the argument `inceptionV3.chrome.json` is a single-execution trace of operation execution times, and is obtained using the Chrome Trace profiler.

2. Run the **MinMax** partitioning algorithm over the topology. Specify the number of partitions (K) and the number of topological orderings (nruns) to evaluate before settling for the best result.
```
In [71]: g.partition_minmax_multiple(K=4, nruns=10)

### Detailed View
For a detailed breakdown of the runtime steps, execute the function calls shown below:

1. Create a `GraphTopology` object:
```
In [70]: g = Graph.GraphTopology('inceptionV3.tflite', 'inceptionV3.chrome.json')
```

2. Perform a topological sort
```
In [73]: g.topological_sort()
```


3. Partition the graph into K sub-graphs, using the topological order obtained above
```
In [74]: g.partition_graph(K=4)
```

4. View the execution time of each partition
```

**Note** Please set debug levels in the script accordingly, for example, `g.set_dbglevel(logging.DEBUG)`.

## Example Script To Generate Partition Map
An example script `test_parition.py` is added to the folder. Please run `python3 test_partition.py --help` for details. The script parses the TFLite model file and the trace JSON as arguments, and creates a `partition_map.json` at the same location as the TFLite file. An output from running `test_partition.py` is shown below:

```
