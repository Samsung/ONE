## How to generate Circle schema python script

(This is not mandatory since it already included default Circle schema generated by following procedure.)

* When circle adapter loads the Circle model and displays in Model Explorer, it uses Circle schema.
* With the help of a flatbuffer compiler, we can create a Circle schema python interface for use in Circle adapter.
```
flatc -p --gen-onefile --gen-object-api circle_schema.fbs
```
* Note: For `--gen-onefile` option, you need to use the latest version of `flatc`. (tested version = v24.3.25)
