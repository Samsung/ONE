## diff-ops-outputs.py

### Purpose

This tool compares the outputs of all operations from ONE runtime and other runtime (or interpreter). If any output file is different, it report the diff. As other runtime, modified Tensorflow Lite
Interpreter or Circle interpreter could be used.

Why is this tool needed?

Some model has many ops. For example, a large model we're testing has more than 50,000 ops.
With such models, if the output of the model is wrong, we should pin-point which operation starts to
work incorrectly by checkint the output of the all operations. This tool automates such task.

### How to use

```
./python diff-ops-outputs -1 <ONE-op-output-dir> -2 <comparing-dir> -d 0.01
# -1 <ONE-op-output-dir> contains op output files and `sequence.txt` from ONE runtime
# -2 <comparing-dir> contains op output files from TensorFlow Lite Interpreter
# -d is delta within which two values are considered equal
```

Files of <dir1> can be generated by the following command:
