# one-import-onnx-ext

_one-import-onnx-ext_ follows _one_import_onnx_ extension discuessed in
https://github.com/Samsung/ONE/issues/10702.

_one-import-onnx-ext_ acts as simple wrapper to execute _onnx2circle_ tool
to convert ONNX model to Circle model.

## now disabled

As `onnx2circle` is (going to be) default ONNX conversion tool,
`one-import-onnx-ext` is not used anymore as driver of `onnx2circle`.
