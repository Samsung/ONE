/**
 * @brief Tensor object that indirects to the tensor it is pointing to.
 *
 * A executor's I/O tensor could be two types.
 *
 * 1. @c UserTensor, if it is the primary graph (package's input/output)
 * 2. Any other derivative of @c IPortableTensor from another executor, otherwise
 *
 * To support these, this object indirects everything to the actual tensor pointer.
 *
 * IOTensor is derived from IPortableTensor, and it also have "_info" field.
 * "_info" field is accessed by IPortableTensor's getter method.
 *
 * It assumes that IOTensor's info is always same with actual tensor's info except shape.
 * setTensor() updates IOTensor's info's shape to actual tensor shape.
 * Actual tensor's info should not be updated directly after setTensor() call until
 * executor's execution is finished, instead it is allowed to update actual tensor's info
 * indirectly by IOTensor's setter methods.
