/**
 * @brief An optimization pass that removes Permute operations if possible
 *
 * There may be some Permute operations that are inserted by PermutationInsertionPass or other
 * passes. This pass checks all Permute operations and eliminates them if Permute in/out tensors
 * are compatible and layouts match.
 *
 * Permute input tensor is kept and the output is removed for all the cases, except model outputs.
 * As all output tensors have to be builtin backend, so the output is kept.
 *
 * @note This is an optimization pass which means that everything should work fine even if this pass
 *       was skipped.
