# circle-partitioner-test

_circle-partitioner-test_ provides test of circle-partitioner;
to test partitioning is working correctly, without value testing.
- full value testing is done with _circle-part-value-test_.

before value testing, in local. After you've checked model partitioning is
working as you expect, you can add test to _circle-part-value-test_.

It is not necessary to commit to test of this module to upstream.
