## What is circlechef?

Do you need a circle model for testing? Ask it to _circlechef_.
Given a recipe, _circlechef_ will cook a circle model for you.

**NOTE** _circlechef_ covers only what _tflchef_ does not cover. This is to support ops that exist only in circle shema, and other things can be made using _tflchef_ and _tflite2circle_.
