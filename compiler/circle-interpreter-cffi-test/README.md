# circle-interpreter-cffi-test

The `circle_interpereter_cffi` library wrapped with CFFI is designed to expose
an existing `luci-interpreter` class to Python. It simplifies the integration of
the class by creating a Python-compatible interface using CFFI.

`circle-interpreter-cffi-test` ensures that the Python bindings for the C++
library correctly. Specifically, it verifies that:

1. The CFFI-wrapped library can succesfully load the circle model.
2. Inputs passed from Python are correctly interpreted by the `luci-interpreter`.
3. The output generated by the interpreter matches the expected results.

This test provides confidence that `luci-interpter`, when accessed through
the Python interface, produces the same results as the original implementation.
