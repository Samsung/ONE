 * @brief   Class to convert NCHW Ops to NHWC
 *
 * @details Find operators that use NCHW layout and make them use NHWC.
 *          Strictly speaking, it is impossible to distinguish whether
 *          an operator is using NCHW or NHWC without programmers' annotations.
 *          But we guess the data layout of each operator as much as possible
 *          based on the assumptions described in the comments.
 *          Note that this Pass does not change the execution result even
 *          for the false-positive cases.
