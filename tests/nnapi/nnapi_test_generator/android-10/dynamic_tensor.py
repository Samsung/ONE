'''
class to add dynamic tensor input by adding Reshape layer

Example test code would look like the following:

--------
import dynamic_tensor

model = Model()

model_input_shape = [1, 2, 3]

dynamic_layer = DynamicInputGenerator(model, model_input_shape)

test_node_input = dynamic_layer.getTestNodeInput()

# write ABS test. input is `test_input`
# note output shape is dynamic and not known.
# However, we need to provide any shape that can hold test output. Otherwise, TestGenerated.cpp will fail
model_output = Output("output", "TENSOR_FLOAT32", "{1, 6}")

model.Operation("ABS", test_node_input).To(model_output)

model_input_data = [1, -2, 3, -4, 5, -6]
model_output_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Example({
    # use these two as input
    dynamic_layer.getModelInput(): model_input_data,
    dynamic_layer.getShapeInput() : model_input_shape,

    model_output: model_output_data,
})
--------

The above code creates a model with two inputs and the values in the first input (dynamic tensor)
is passed to the input of testing op.

      input [1, 2, 3]  shape [3]  (value of shape will be [1, 2, 3])
          |             |
          +-------------+
          |
       Reshape (added by DynamicInputGenerator since it generates its output to be dynamic)
          |
          | dynamic tensor at compilation time but the shape will be [1, 2, 3] at execution time
          |
         Abs
          | dynamic tensor, [1, 2, 3] at execution time
