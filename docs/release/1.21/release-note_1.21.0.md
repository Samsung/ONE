## ONE Runtime

### Basic Multimodel nnpackage
- Runtime supports to run nnpackage with two models

### Channel Wise Quantization on Conv2D and Depthwise Conv2D
- Conv2D and Depthwise Conv2D supports per-channel quantization of uint8 type. 

### Batch Execution with TRIX backend
- TRIX backend supports batch execution which run in parallel with multicore
